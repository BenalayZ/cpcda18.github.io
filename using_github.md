## Updating PCDA Materials with GitHub Desktop



Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

Open GitHub Desktop and log in with your account. Click the '+' on the upper left to create or download (clone)  a project. Select 'pcda' and click 'Clone pcda.'

The client will take a moment to download.

When it's done you'll see a log of past project edits.

Click 'No Uncommitted Changes' at the top to see the interface you'll spend most of your time in. Since we haven't made any changes yet, everything is blank.

Navigate to your project directory and open a text file. Each page is in Markdown format, which has almost no learning curve. Here's a [quick reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) I like.

Any plaintext editor will do; I'm using [Typora](https://typora.io/), which displays Markdown nicely.
