### Exercises
Right click the following link and save the Jupyter notebook file to `sharedfolder` on your desktop.
[Karsdorp, Chapter 3: Text Analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fbkarsdorp/python-course/blob/master/answerbook/Chapter%203%20-%20Text%20analysis.ipynb)

### Getting started
Open Terminal in macOS and launch our Docker container:

```
docker rm -f pcda_ubuntu
docker pull pcda17/ubuntu-container
docker run --name pcda_ubuntu -ti -p 8889:8889 --volume ~/Desktop/sharedfolder/:/sharedfolder/ pcda17/ubuntu-container
```

In Windows 10, open PowerShell and enter the following to launch the Docker container:

```
docker rm -f pcda_ubuntu
docker pull pcda17/ubuntu-container
docker run --name pcda_ubuntu -ti -p 8889:8889 --volume C:\Users\***username_here***\Desktop\sharedfolder:/sharedfolder/ pcda17/ubuntu-container
```

Open any browser and type (your Juypter Notebook will launch):
```
localhost:8889
```

Topics to Cover
---------------

-   preprocessing for text machine learning:

    -   removing stop words

    -   lemmatizing

-   classifying texts using scikit-learn

-   author attribution

-   cluster analysis



Provide collection of several hundred texts grouped by genre:

- news articles
- blog posts
- literary prose
- poetry
- scientific articles
- spam emails

Have students choose two or three categories to work with.

Using scikit-learn rain ML model using small number of texts and measure classification accuracy for remaining set.

Train model using more texts and see if thereâ€™s any improvement.

Compare models.

Look at mis-classified texts and discuss what features make them outliers.



#### Break

Demonstrate cluster analysis.


Sentiment analysis: Evaluate/classify Twitter data.
